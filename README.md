# Neovim-config

This is just my Neovim config. I followed a YouTuber called Josean Martinez.
But I only added the *very* neccessary plugins because my computer is really slow.
These plugins include: treesitter, which-key, telescope, lualine and a colorscheme.
You may realise I have no linter, no tree, no parser, no debugger, no nothing.
This is a very basic setup for my basic computer.
